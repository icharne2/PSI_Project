# Project description

This project was written using **PyTorch Lightning** and aims to **compare different deep learning models** for the task of **handwritten digit recognition (MNIST)**.

It includes:
- a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- transfer learning using the **ResNet50** architecture
- a sequential **LSTM model**
- functions for **hyperparameter tuning**
- data analysis and result visualization
- model training, validation, and performance evaluation
